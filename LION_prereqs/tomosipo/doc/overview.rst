.. rubric:: High-performance 3D tomography with flexible geometries in Python

Tomosipo is a pythonic wrapper for the ASTRA-toolbox of
high-performance GPU primitives for 3D tomography.

The aim of tomosipo is to:

1. Expose a user-friendly API for 3D tomography;
2. Enable easy manipulation and visualisation of 3D geometries;
3. Express high-performance GPU-accelerated algorithms succinctly.

First steps
===========

Are you new to tomosipo? This is the place to start!

* **From scratch:**
  :doc:`Installation <intro/install>`

* **Tutorials:**
  :doc:`intro/forward_projection` | :doc:`intro/simple_reconstruction`

* **Advanced Tutorials:**
  :doc:`intro/fast_reconstruction` | :doc:`intro/lab_frame`


How the documentation is organized
==================================

Tomosipo has different types of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's
organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* :doc:`Tutorials </intro/index>` take you by the hand through a series of steps
  to create a tomographic reconstruction. Start here if you're new to tomosipo
  or tomography.

* :doc:`Topic guides </topics/index>` discuss key topics and concepts at a
  fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* :doc:`Reference guides </ref/index>` serve as technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of tomosipo's machinery.

* :doc:`How-to guides </howto/index>` are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  goal-oriented than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how tomosipo works.
